# stability-gain-with-multiple-INs
This repository contains the code from the bioRxiv manuscript:

Bos, Miehl et al., (2024) "Untangling stability and gain modulation in cortical circuits with multiple interneuron classes".


Each figure can be reproduced by running the respective code, i.e. Fig_1.m will reproduce Fig. 1 in the manuscript etc. 

Suppl. Figure S1 can be generated with the code Fig_5.m, and Suppl. Figure S2 with the code Fig_7.m (see documentation in the respective file).
