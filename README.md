This repository contains the code from the bioRxiv manuscript:

Bos, Miehl et al., (2025) "Untangling stability and gain modulation in cortical circuits with multiple interneuron classes".
Link: https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/99808


Each figure can be reproduced by running the respective code, i.e. Fig_1.m will reproduce Fig. 1 in the manuscript etc. 

Figure 5 - supplement figure 1 can be generated with the code Fig_5.m, and Figure 7 - supplement figure 1 with the code Fig_7.m (see documentation in the respective file).
